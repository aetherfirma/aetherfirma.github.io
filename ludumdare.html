                    Ludum Dare is a thrice annual 48 hour game making competition, where thousands of
                    people around the world compete to build a game to a theme announced at the start
                    of the competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've entered the competition six times so far, and completed it three times.

                <h3>Prison Break (LD33)</h3>
                <p>
                    Prison Break is a 3D twitch space dogfighting game, and an exercise in making sure
                    you leave some time to follow the theme. (<a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=21100">Entry Page</a>)
                </p>
                <h3>You Only Dare Thrice (LD32)</h3>
                <p>
                    A procedurally generated spy thriller, you play as a spy tracking down the stolen
                    components of a superweapon. The dialogue system was neat, even if the story and
                    gameplay needed work. Whilst I ran out of time to put in proper buildings, the
                    placeholders served the gameplay well regardless. (<a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=21100">Entry Page</a>)
                </p>
                <h3>Inquisition (LD28)</h3>
                <p>
                    Your daughter has been kidnapped by the inquisition to buy your compliance. You have
                    28 days to either submit yourself to them, or flee the country. Can you save your
                    daughter? Arguably my favourite of my entries and the one that works the best. I'd
                    quite like to go back and revisit this at some point, turn it into more of a proper
                    game. (<a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=21100">Entry Page</a>)

                <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
                <p>
                    Sadly I have to miss Ludum Dare 35 as it runs on the same weekend as the Salute 2016
                    wargaming show but I fully expect to participate in Ludum Dare 36 and plan to try and
                    run some sort of meetup in London to jam together.
